## RevBayes Homework Two

1. In the slide move, try 5 different ranges for the slide move. Which one produces the best ESS? 

2. In the slide move, try 5 different ranges for the scale move. Which one produces the best ESS? 

3. How does using both moves change the ESS? Why does this make (or not make) sense? 

4. What happens if you double one of the moves? For example, if you have a scale move that means the mu prime will be far from the mu, _and_ one that implies the mu prime should be really different? 

##Try to have this done by the end of the work week, but if it's done by the end of spring break, that's OK, too.
