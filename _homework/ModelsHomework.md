##Models Homework

1. From section "What is parsimony doing anyway?": How is the parsimony score impacted if you set a different number of characters to the custom model? For this answer, give the ctype command that you used to set up the model, and the number of parsimony steps in the best tree uncovered.

2. From section "Transitions and Transversions". Try the same analysis, except with a 3-1 weighting on transitions to transversions. For this answer, paste below your transition matrix and provide the parsimony score. Also note if there were any major differences in the consensus tree built from the 2-1 transition-transversion model and the consensus tree built from 3-1 transition-transversion model.

3. So far, we looked at models that vary in two paramters, base frequencies and transition/transversion bias. Which parameter made a bigger difference? Does this make sense to you? Why or why not?
