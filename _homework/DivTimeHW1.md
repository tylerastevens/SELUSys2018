## DivTime HW1

1. When we describe the FBD as a mechanistic model, what does that mean? How does this contrast to node calibrations?

A mechanistic model is a model in which there is a hypothesized relationship between independently measured parameters, and the understanding of these parameters in conjunction with this hypothesized relationship between them contribute to the analysis of the data.  The independently measured parameters of the FBD of speciation rate, extinction rate, fossil recovery rate and proportion of extant species sampled all interact when performing the calibration.  This differs from standard node calibrations in which underlying biological processes are not included in the calibration of the node.

2. When we apply a node calibration, what are we trying to describe? 
A node calibration is an attempt to describe the molecular clock or rate of evolution associated with a species or group of species.  A node calibration rescales evolutionary distances over time to provide an estimate of the dates of divergence and the dates associated with the most recent common ancestor.  This calibration allows for a better understanding of the rate of evolution and a more accurate description and classification of phylogenetic relationships.
