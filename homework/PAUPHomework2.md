3. In your own words, what is a bootstrap analysis? Does it make sense to describe a bootstrap value as the probability that a grouping on a tree is correct?  

A bootstrap analysis measures the strength of data in support of a hypothesis and the repeatability of a tree by performing multiple rounds of subsampling of the original data set in order to simulate the variability of character distribution.  The bootstrap value is not the probability that the tree is correct, but rather represents the relative data support of the hypothesized tree.

4. What might be a situation in which you would want to use the jackknife instead of the bootstrap? 

Jackknife could be useful when attempting to see what effect the removal of certain species has on the outcome of the tree since Jackknife subsamples data sets without replacement.  The resulting tree could then possibly contain groupings that were not present in the original tree.


5. Transfer your trees to your desktop. Use FigTree or IcyTree to view them. Take a screenshot, and save it to the fig folder in the class repository. Below, complete the file path to where you have the file in the fig directory to embed the image of your screen shot.
