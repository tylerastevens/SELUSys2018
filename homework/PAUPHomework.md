## PAUP and Parsimony Lab

1. From the iterative alignment section: Which aslignment (pasta_script1, pasta_script2, pasta_script3) do you think is the "best"? By what criteria did you arrive at this decision? 

2. In tree searching, when would you expect the swap algorithm to matter strongly?

3. In your own words, what is a bootstrap analysis? Does it make sense to describe a bootstrap value as the probability that a grouping on a tree is correct?

4. What might be a situation in which you would want to use the jackknife instead of the bootstrap? 


5. Transfer your trees to your desktop. Use FigTree or IcyTree to view them. Take a screenshot, and save it to the fig folder in the class repository. Below, complete the file path to where you have the file in the fig directory to embed the image of your screen shot. 

![Embed your bootstrap tree here](../fig/your_bootstrap_tree_image) 

![Embed your jackknife tree here](../fig/your_jackknife_tree_image) 


## Add, commit, and push your homework by 5 pm on Friday.
