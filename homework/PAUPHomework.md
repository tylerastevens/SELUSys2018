## PAUP and Parsimony Lab

1. From the iterative alignment section: Which aslignment (pasta_script1, pasta_script2, pasta_script3) do you think is the "best"? By what criteria did you arrive at this decision? 

After viewing the results from the alignment analysis using FastSP, it was determined that pastascript_2 had the most homologies in comparison with the other scripts.  Therefore, this iterative alignment represents the best alignment out of the three possible choices.  

2. In tree searching, when would you expect the swap algorithm to matter strongly?

The size of the tree would be a major factor in regards to the swap algorithm.  The swap algorithm applied to smaller trees would matter much more than the algorithm applied to larger trees. Branch swapping or variable swapping on a smaller tree would have a greater impact on the resulting phylogeny in comparison to branch swapping on a larger, more complex tree.  

3. In your own words, what is a bootstrap analysis? Does it make sense to describe a bootstrap value as the probability that a grouping on a tree is correct?

4. What might be a situation in which you would want to use the jackknife instead of the bootstrap? 


5. Transfer your trees to your desktop. Use FigTree or IcyTree to view them. Take a screenshot, and save it to the fig folder in the class repository. Below, complete the file path to where you have the file in the fig directory to embed the image of your screen shot.

## Add, commit, and push your homework by 5 pm on Friday.
